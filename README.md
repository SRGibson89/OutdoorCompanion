# Outdoor Companion

This is the android version of my Disseration application 

My dissertation was an evaluation of geolocation using Android and iOS. My aim was to find out if a smart phone can be used as a personal safety device for hillwalking and other outdoor activities such as cycling or cross country running. The apps were built natively in Android Studio using Java for Android and XCode using swift for iOS. My apps allow a user to set a timer, and when it expires it will send their current or last known GPS location to a contact of the user’s choice with a link to google maps. The applications have additional features such as: a panic button (allowing a user in trouble to send an immediate message), and a digital flare (which works by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot and changing the SSID to say “help me”).
